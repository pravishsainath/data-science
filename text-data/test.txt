The waitresses are very friendly.	1
useless phone, simply deaf.	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0
I really liked that.  	1
This was like the final blow!	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
Bad Choice.	0
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Highly recommended.	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
!I definitly recommend!!	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.	1
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
The service was a bit lacking.	0
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.	1
This place has it!	1
The problem was the script.  	0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
Not impressed.	0
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.	1
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
It was horrendous.  	0
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.	0
Excellent wallet type phone case.	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Too politically correct.  	0
Great phone!.	1
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
It deserves strong love.  	1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
best bluetooth on the market.	1
WORST PHONE EVER.	0
Waitress was good though!	1
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
W810i is just SUPERB.	1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
I don't think you will be disappointed.  	1
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.	0
I was seated immediately.	1
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	0
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0

All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.	0

At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
Totally believable.  	1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
Won't go back.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	1
the phone was unusable and was not new.	0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	1
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	1
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1

The pleather case doesn't fit.	0
Wow... Loved this place.	1
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.	1
The food, amazing.	1
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
Great Value.	1
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.	0
Good transmit audio.	1
What a big waste of time.	0
Very good stuff for the price.	1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
The warm beer didn't help.	0
Will be back again!	1
It is a true classic.  	1
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1
Avoid at all cost!	0
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
Very good lunch spot.	1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
Waste your money on this game.  	1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1
Incredible!.	1
Worst Customer Service Ever.	0
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
DELICIOUS!!	1
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
Voice recognition is tremendous!	1
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.	1
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Service is also cute.	1
I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.	1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0
It's practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  	1
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
I'm a bit disappointed.	0
Superb Phone on a Great Network.	1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
They dropped more than the ball.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.	0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!	1
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
It was pretty gross!	0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
It Was So Cool.  	1
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.	0
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
very disappointed.	0

The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	1
Check it out.	1
Very friendly staff.	1
I'm still infatuated with this phone.	1
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	1
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
Give this one a look.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
Great audio!.	1
A bit predictable.  	0
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
